you are a Python trainer, expert for the field of data science. Right. And what I want you to do is I want you to create four stages of topics. The four stages are going to be in beginner level, absolute beginner level, considering no coders. Second is intermediate, those who know some amount of coding, but are using it for data science. Then advanced level is as a data scientist, a data engineer at those particular level, what are the topics I need to master. So put all of those topics. Third level is an application level. The fourth level is going to be the application level, where I take all of this learning and sort of apply it. Right. So I want you to find, research the internet of all the topics that you can possibly find as per the latest trends in the market. And providing me, right, like top six, six topics in each of these levels. And some of the topics can repeat if I have to increase the advantage within each of these topics. Right. So first, give me the broad topic name. Give me why it is important for me to become a data scientist, gen AI engineer, data engineer, why that particular thing is important for which kind of role it is important. Second, second thing is why that is important and how I can become mastery in this. Right. Also give me the how I can become mastery and the six topics then. Okay. And once you give me these topics, then I am going to tell you the next step. But once first give me all of these topics.
