Now, for Stage 1, Data Structure, I want you to create 10 problem statements. Each 10 problem statements, these are the things, it will begin with easy questions and it will end and gradually increase the complexity till 10 questions. I want you to establish the scenario, what is the scenario of the problem statement. I want you to have some fake data or starter code that is there for me to understand that code. If there is a code, always have some code backed with it. And then what you do is, I want you to find like 2-2 questions for each of the topics that are, sub-topics that are there for each of it. If you can, if there are more topics and you are going beyond 10, that's also fine. But as long as you have 2 different questions for each of the topics that we have, so that, you know, you give the scenario, you ask the questions, you give us some sample code or sample data to start with, and then give the exact problem statement or the task in a very crisp manner so that I can read it, understand it, and have like a step-by-step instruction so that I can use that to practice writing the code. That way it will help me increase, but don't give me the solution. So set up the entire scenario, all the problem statements, and I will basically use that to solve the problem.
